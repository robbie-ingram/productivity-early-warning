# productivity-early-warning (in progress)

this project is an ongoing personal project aiming to take 3 years of data I've
collected on myself and use it to develop an 'early warning' tool for decreases
in professional productivity. the main idea is to train the model to take metrics
from 'today' and use it to predict my work efficiency 'tomorrow.'

If I don't like the predicted value, or if it is flagged as low in some way, I have 
an early warning to take steps to mitigate the potential decrease. this tool also
helps to prevent burnout, as drops in work output can be predicted in advance.
